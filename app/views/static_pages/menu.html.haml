    %h2 Personal Pizzas
    Our personal pizzas are made to order with the freshest organic ingredients we can find. We always try to source our ingredients as locally as possible. Add any toppings you want at no extra charge (toppings vary daily)! We also sometimes have a gluten free* crust option available (ask a chef for details). Pizza is not available every day, so check Facebook and Twitter for updates to see when we have it. We will start serving pizza in the winter for a warm, crusty, and cheesy (or cheezy for you vegans) treat.<br>

      *while all of the ingredients used in our gluten free items are free of gluten, please note that the Food Co-Op is not a gluten free environment<br>
