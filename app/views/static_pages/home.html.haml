  served at noon, and a bulk section with a variety of nuts, grains, and dried fruits, you'll find a variety of food unique to this establishment.

  Often touted as the best meal on campus, the Co-op serves a mostly organic, vegetarian meal, often with gluten-free options, sourced from fresh ingredients. When local is an option, area farms supply produce, as well as eggs, milk, and cheese.
  <br><br>
  To find the Co-op, first enter the Union by the bus stop, take the stairs down to the basement from the Tillman Lobby, and walk all the way down the hall. The Co-op can be found in the back right corner. With the current construction, this is the only way to access the Co-op.
